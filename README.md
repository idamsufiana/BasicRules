## Basic rules 

	1. Daily leetcode (Optimal solution) Replenish them every week 
	2. Solid Algorithm & data Structure
	3. Implement clean code and clean architecture while build apps (Refactoring pdf also recomended)
	4. Finish your spring boot course (All shits like Security, Transactional or implement mongo), 
 	Xml parser and AOP cases are frequently missing when you only rely on office tasks
 	5. Create Rest and Restful API in several Frameworks  
	6. Create and publish personal website project
	7. Practice ci/cd (Gitlab CI, Jenkins), container orchestration (Kubernetes) and Message Broker (Kafka)
 	8. Treat unit test as important as development
	9. ERD Diagram & DB handling, Indexing, Redis, database pooling, avoiding sql injection etc
	10. Learn system design
	11. Choose one JS framework as FrontEnd that you're comfortable most
  	12. follow tech Youtuber to stay update latest tech and create a nice setup to make a good life
   	13. Be a Multi-Languages programmer, Python is other best choice
    14. Make everyday deadline: for leetcode, practice, take a course or project.
    15. Be Proactive and autonomous
